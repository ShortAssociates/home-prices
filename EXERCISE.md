Thank you for your continued interest in MIO Partners’ DevOps Engineer position. As discussed, we would like to invite you to complete a case study as part of our recruiting and interviewing process.

I’ve attached a .zip file containing 3 spreadsheets, named below, for the case to this email. Please reply to me immediately to confirm you have received and can view the case material.

1.      HomeInventory.csv - the amount of homes listed for sale in each region for each month

2.      MedianPriceReductionPct.csv - the median percentage price reduction for homes in each region for each month

3.      States.csv – a simple mapping between state codes and names

You should return your completed case study via email to paul_solano@miopartners.com, Farhana_Tasnim@miopartners.com and Michael_Supon@miopartners.com by  10:00 am on Monday, March 19th

We expect this case to take candidates to ~ 3-4 hours to complete and ask that, when returning cases, please send them as .pdf, .rar, or .gz files as any other compressed file formats may be rejected by the MIO mail server.

For reference, the objectives of the case study are:

·         To give the candidate a glimpse of the kind of work the team does. Although highly simplified, these are real life examples of things we care about. This should help the candidate to evaluate “is this job the right role for me?” as an additional point of information.

·         It gives MIO a chance to see an actual end-product of the candidate’s work.  Is the work well structured? Are important nuances accounted for?  Is the presentation concise and clean? Are spreadsheets (if any) and code well done?

·         Part of the interview process will focus on discussing your case study. It gives both MIO and the candidate the opportunity to engage and simulate how working with one another would be.

 Thank you once again for your interest in MIO and for taking the time to solve these cases,

MIO Recruiting

DevOps case study instructions:

Plot the correlation between the number of homes for sale and the Median Price Cut in each state.

The final data set should have the average number of homes for sale and the average Median Price Cut for each state, year-by-year (not month-by-month).

We are interested in data for the following states:

·         New Jersey

·         California

·         Vermont

·         Colorado

·         New York

For the following years: 2011-2016

 

The code should be well-organized, readable, runnable, and adhere to standard OO practices and design.

The code should be written in python 2.7+, you can use any built-in or third-party libraries. (Use of the pandas python library is preferred.)

§  Evaluate whether the amount of homes for sale has an effect on the Median Price Cut.

§  Find the state/year combination with the highest apparent correlation.

§  Find the state/year combination with the lowest apparent correlation.

§  Try to graph the correlation using any simple graphing library. (see http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/13a36f70a4f060b97e41 for an easy implementation)

The data was downloaded from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

 

Candidate to Return:

1.      The code: All Python files constituting your code.  These should be well structured and commented so we can easily follow the code logic.  Use your best programming skills for this exercise, as we will use it to evaluate how well you structure your code.

2.      Outputs: The outputs listed in the case description.  These should match what we get when we run your code.

3.      A write-up: A short (<500 words) document explaining how you structured your code and why, and a concise executive summary interpreting the numbers. You should ensure that the rationale for your conclusions is clearly articulated (for example, the use of charts to support your conclusions is highly encouraged).

What are the rules?

Feel free to consult any literature to solve the case to the best of your abilities, but ensure you solve the case yourself and are in command of all the answers you submit; it is preferable to have one fully documented and clearly articulated answer (even if it is not 100% right) than all the correct answers with no explanation. 

Please email us if you have questions you need to discuss in order to proceed and please. (paul_solano@miopartners.com, Farhana_Tasnim@miopartners.com and Michael_Supon@miopartners.com)

When is the case due?

Unless otherwise discussed, you have 2 days to complete the case. For example, if we send out the cases on Friday, we would like to have them back Monday morning.

What happens once I return a completed case study?

Upon receipt of your materials, we will review them in detail and decide whether we want to invite you for a presentation. Some teams prefer to discuss case results over a call; others prefer to do so at an onsite interview.

How is my case evaluated?

This varies from team- to- team however, generally speaking, initiative, creativity, clarity of thought and communication are all paramount in our evaluation criteria.
